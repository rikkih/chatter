# Chatter Messaging App

A simple messaging server to have online conversations freely, with no chat data being stored whatsoever.

### Run Locally

On a Unix system, you can run:

```
$ make build runserver
```

Open up a browser and go to `localhost:8000/chat/`

From here you can create a chatroom.

More functionality soon.
